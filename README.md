# CoronaVirusPrediction
Facebook Prophet model predicts the number of Corona virus confirmed. 

I compared the predicted result(next a few days) and the real confirmed number by myself, and the result was almost correct.
The model is trained with prediction results everytimes. (If predict next 7 days, it might be trained 8 times with prediction results.)
original.csv is the file from the reference.
